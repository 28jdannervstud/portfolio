            <p class="darkgreen">Destroy Geometry Sumulator is a game coded in Roblox Lua, with a central gameplay loop of defeating (or, "destroying") various three dimensional geometric shapes to gain "EXP," the game's primary resource.</p>
            <p class="darkgreen">Once the player obtains enough "EXP," they are able to progress through a large door to the next area.</p>
            <p class="darkgreen">While Spheres are the most recognizable of the game's shapes, there are also enemy Cubes and Cyllinders, each bearing their own traits.</p>
